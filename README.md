My solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, written in Gleam.

I am in no way affiliated with the Rust Foundation, I just use an another language
that has its compiler written in Rust.

## Usage

All of the solutions are in the `src` directory, under `day_x.gleam` modules.
The solutions have tests, which can be run with `gleam test`.
